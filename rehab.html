            1. Set a Date to Quit Vaping
        </h3>
        <p>
            Setting a date to quit vaping can be an important first step. Keep the following tips in mind when setting a date to quit vaping:
            Give yourself time to get ready. Getting ready can boost your confidence and give you the skills you’ll need to stay vape-free.
            Don’t put it off for too long. When you pick a date too far away it gives you time to change your mind or become less interested in quitting. Choose a date that is close — no more than a week or two away.
            Set yourself up for success. Try not to pick a quit date that will be stressful. Pick a day where you can fully focus on ignoring the cravings.

        <h4>2. Think about different treatment options </h4>
        <p>
            There are two general options when considering treatment. You can try to stop vaping cold-turkey at home or you can seek help in a professional treatment facility. Although it is hard to stop vaping cold-turkey at home, it is not impossible. The withdrawal period for nicotine is not nearly as dangerous as it is for some other drugs

        <h4>3. Consider Nicotine Replacement Therapy</h4>
        <p>
            You can also consider tapering off of nicotine slowly through using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as a way of continuing to give your brain nicotine, but in a controlled way that is gradually reduced. The following products are often used for NRT:

Nicotine patches. A transdermal patch that you attach to your skin and the nicotine absorbs into your bloodstream.
Nicotine gum. Nicotine replacement therapy gum may be an easy, convenient way for some people to taper off of nicotine.
Nicotine lozenges. Lozenges that you can suck on to get a small dose of nicotine.
An important factor to keep in mind with these products is that they work best in combination with a vaping cessation program, which may include support groups or counseling
