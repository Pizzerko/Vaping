  <h1> What is vaping?</h1>
    
    <p> Vaping is the use of elecrtonic cigarettes. Also known as E-cigarettes. E-cigarettes were invented in 2003. Many people vape 
      because they believe that vaping is safer than normal cigarette smoking. However, like normal 
      cigarettes, E-cigarettes contain nicotine. Nicotine is a very addictive chemical and it increases stress. In 2011, 7 million people had already 
      begun to use E-cigarettes. In 2020, this number jumped to an astounding 68 million, and jumped to 82 million in 2021. The amount of people who use 
      E-cigarettes globally is almost the same as the total population of Germany. In 2020, 50 percent of high school students reported using E-cigarettes.
