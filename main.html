  <h1> What is vaping?</h1>
    <!--Done and researched independently from Vikram-->
      <p> Vaping is the use of elecrtonic cigarettes, also known as E-cigarettes. Invented in 2003, vape was widely popular Many people vape 
        because they believe that vaping is safer than normal cigarette smoking. However, like normal 
        cigarettes, E-cigarettes contain nicotine. Nicotine is a very addictive chemical and it increases stress. In 2011, 7 million people had already 
        begun to use E-cigarettes. In 2020, this number jumped to an astounding 68 million, and jumped to 82 million in 2021. The amount of people who use 
        E-cigarettes globally is almost the same as the total population of Germany. In 2020, 50 percent of high school students reported using E-cigarettes.
