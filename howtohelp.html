            1. Be Supportive Towards Victims
        </h3>
        <p>
            If there are any victims, you personally know, that vape, smoking, or drug use in general, reach out if possible. We should provide as much support since many who partake in these activities use it to lessen anxiety and find relief.
            With our discussions of the symptoms, we understand vaping does the opposite effect of relief. For victims that you aren't personally connected with, contacting an adult may be best to help the individual. Don't see
            it as snitching; see it as supporting their well-being. Finally, avoid any judgement towards victims. Any form of judgement is, one, disrespectful and, two, doing the opposite of helping victims break away from vape/drugs.

        <h4>2. Be An Activist </h4>
        <p>
            Spreading informational posters, creating clubs advocating for a drug-free environment, or being apart of drug-free initiatives are all examples of being 
            an activist. As long as we inform drug users of the negative effects, while creating a supportive environment for those quitting, we can incentivize less drug use. Joining anti-drug campaigns
            and donating to these causes are also extremely beneficial for decreasing drug use.

        <h4>3. Connect Previous Victims With Current </h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes, victims may find it difficult to quit, despite realizing the harmful effects and having a supportive community. Instead, having an ex-victim of vaping/drug abuse can help
            convince the current victims since a personal connection can be formed. Having someone to relate with may create a more comfortable and understanding setting, allowing victims to more likely 
            follow given advice and take steps towards being vape/drug free. With a difficult addiction to combat, it's important to ensure the victim has full support and comfort for their journey to quit.
