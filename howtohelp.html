            1. Catch people who vape already
        </h3>
        <p>
            Look for places that people vape mostly in. It will be extremely hard because the one thing that most vapers make sure to do is not be caught, especially by faculty members. 
            During free periods, or when you use the restroom, go take a look in quiet areas of your school, such as the restroom, stairs, auditorium, playgrounds, or corners of the hallway
            Remember, when you catch someone vaping, do not confront them, immediately report it to your teacher or another nearby member. 
            Some people who vape are not the brightest people to confront, so be careful

        <h4>2. Be an activist </h4>
        <p>
            Being an activist doesn't necessarily mean that you need to go outside and protest. Being an activist could just 
            be writing research papers or creating websites. If you don't have time to do this, you could simply be 
            an activist by spreading informational posters in your school or posting anti-vaping ideas on social media. 
            As long as you are getting the word out about how vaping has a negative affect, you are being an activist

        <h4>3. Speak to vaping victims </h4>
        <p>
            This may seem hard but it is actually not. You could possibly find people who used to vape at your school, but they now
            understand how vaping made them worse person. You could interview them and record your interview, so vapers can understand why vaping is not good.  
            You could also try to find some online vaping victims, and have them write an article on a webstie that you created about anti-vaping. 
            Obviously, these are not the only ways you could get into contact with vaping victims, but the general point is try to get in contact with them.
